[h1]Cooking Delight[/h1]
Cooking Delight mod is a small work in progress mod that focuses on making the culinary decisions in your playthrough matter more.
In vanilla Terraria food items give 3 different buffs, which are the same but with different intensity. This mod aims to change that by dividing food into different categories (like meat, vegetables, etc.) which give specific buffs.

This is a mod made purely for fun and to get some experience. Inspired by Mindfull Eating mod for Minecraft.
