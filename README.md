# Terraria-CookingDelight
Terraria Cooking Delight mod is a small work in progress mod that focuses on making the culinary decisions in your playthrough matter more.
In vanilla Terraria food items give 3 different buffs, which are the same but with different power [(?)](## "needs revising"). This mod aims to change that by dividing food into different categories (like meat, vegetables, etc.) which give specific buffs.

This is a mod made purely for fun and to get some experience. I don't expect anyone to find a use for it. Inspired by [Mindfull Eating mod for Minecraft](https://youtu.be/NN8Vgj4wrFw?si=eObRdqSU6uKlCD8y).
